# Day One of the 100 Days of Code Python Course

# Exploring the print function- print() as an introduction to Python.
print("Hello World!")

# Reviewing how to adding line breaks into strings.
print("Hello\nGoodbye")

# Exploring concatenate with strings.
print("Hello" + "Goodbye")

# Exploring the input function- input().
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")

# Practice Exercise: Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name.
print(len(input("What is your name?")))

# Len function- len() will count the number of characters in the string or object
msg = "Happy Birthday"
print(len(msg))
# Output will be 14

# Exploring variables
name = input("What is your name?")
print("Hello " + name)

# Practice Exercise: Write a program that will switch the values of A and B
# Think of moving liquid between 2 cups.

a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")

c = a
a = b
b = c

print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)

# Final Project: Write code for a band name generator.

print("Hello! Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
city_name = input("What city did you grow up in?\n")
pet_name = input("What is the name of your pet?\n")
print("Your band name could be " + city_name + " " + pet_name + "?")
