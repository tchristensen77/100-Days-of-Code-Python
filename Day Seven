# Step 1 

# To Do 1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.

# To Do 2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

# To Do 3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.

word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

import random

word = str(random.choice(word_list))

#print(word)

chosen_word = list(word)

guess = input("Choose a letter:\n").lower()

for letter in chosen_word:
  if guess in letter:
    print(True)
  if guess not in letter:
    print(False)
