# Day Two of 100 Days of Code

# Exploring subscripting
print("Hello"[2])

street_name = "Abbey Road"
print(street_name[4] + street_name[7])

# Using type() to determine a data type
num_char = len(input("What is your name?"))
print(type(num_char))

# Using str() to convert other data types into strings
new_num_char = str(num_char)
print("Your name has " + new_num_char + " characters.")

# Using float() to convert interger into floats
a = float(123)
print(a)

# Using int() to convert into integer data type
a = int(123.0)
print(a)

# Exercise 1: Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number

two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
a = int(two_digit_number[0])
b = int(two_digit_number[1])

print(a + b)

# Exercise 2: Write a program to calculate someones BMI

height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")

print(int(float(weight)/(float(height) ** 2)))

# Exercise 3: Write a program to let you how many days, weeks, months, you have left if you live until you're 90.

age = input("What is your current age?")

days = (90-int(age)) * 365
weeks = (90-int(age)) * 52
months = (90-int(age)) * 12

print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")

Final Exercise: Write a program for a tip calculator. 

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = input("What was the total bill?")
tip = input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?")
split = input("How many people to split the bill?")

tip_percent = int(tip)/100
total_with_tip = (float(bill) * tip_percent) + float(bill)
cost_per_person = round(total_with_tip / int(split), 2)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${cost_per_person}")
